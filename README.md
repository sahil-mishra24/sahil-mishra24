Hi there! I'm Sahil Mishra, a beginner coder exploring the world of programming! 
I'm cuurently learning the fundamentals of Python, SQL, Stack, Networking and Flutter development. 
I'm looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly projects.
I'm open to feedback and always eager to connect with fellow beginners.
Fun fact: I'm obsessed with anime and Harry Potter series. (This doesn't make me sound dorky at all, right?)
